This repository contains the crypto-policies data and scripts used in
Fedora.

=== Purpose ===

The purpose is to unify the crypto policies used by different applications
and libraries. That is allow setting a consistent security level for crypto
on all applications in a Fedora system, irrespective of the crypto library
in use.

=== Description ===

The idea is to have few predefined security policies such as LEGACY, DEFAULT
and FUTURE which are set system-wide by the administrator. Then applications
that have no special needs will follow these policies by default. That
way the management of the various crypto applications and libraries used in a
system simplifies significantly.

The current implementations works by setting the desired policy in
/etc/crypto-policies/config. After this file is changed the script
'update-crypto-policies' should be executed, and the new policies
will activate.

The supported back ends in Fedora are:
 * GnuTLS
 * OpenSSL


Currently OpenSSL is made to support system policies using a custom modification,
and we have proposed that method upstream at:
http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3266&user=guest&pass=guest
http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3299&user=guest&pass=guest

NSS does not support fine-grained control of options, but patches are on
the way: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1009429
